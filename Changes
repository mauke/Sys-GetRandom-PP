    - Work around missing _h2ph_pre.ph definitions on FreeBSD.

0.03  2024-09-16
    - Improve build-time h2ph detection.
    - Load sys/syscall.ph directly (instead of syscall.ph); hopefully this'll
      be more portable.

0.02  2024-09-15
    - Try to generate the required *.ph files automatically at build time. This
      should work fine as long as C system headers are available under
      /usr/include.

0.01  2024-06-15
    - initial release
